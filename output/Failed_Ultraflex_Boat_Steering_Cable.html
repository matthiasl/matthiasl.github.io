<h2>
Failed Ultraflex Boat Steering Cable</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted October 14th 2018</em></p>
<p>
  The steering on my boat failed without warning while planing at 20
  knots in choppy seas. The failure happened when the wire inside the
  Ultraflex M66 steering cable broke. The cable was 13 years old, it's
  been used in the (brackish) Baltic sea.
</p>

<p>
  Dangar Marine has a nice
  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ8UruO-_a0'>video</a> which
  shows how to replace a similar cable.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
  The steering cable consists of several layers. Innermost, it's a
  multi-strand steel cable, probably stainless, about 6mm. Next,
  there's a spiral-wound single-strand wire which goes all the way
  along the wire. Outermost, there's a black wire-reinforced plastic
  tube.
</p>
<p>
  The steering wheel at the helm uses cogs to grip the spiral wound
  around the innermost cable, allowing it to both push and pull the
  engine sideways. Pushing steers to starboard, pulling to port.
</p>

<h3>What failed</h3>
<p>
  After replacing the cable with a new one, I chopped the end of the
  old cable where it goes through the engine bracket. Inside, it's
  obvious that the inner wire failed where it's pressed into the rod
  which connects to the engine.
</p>

<p>
  It looks like some moisture got in there over the years, in spite of
  the sliding coaxial tubes being regularly greased and having an
  o-ring designed to prevent water from getting in. The water ate away
  the end of the spiral, where the cable is press-fitted into the
  stainless rod which goes through the engine tilt tube. Every time I
  steered to starboard, this caused the inner cable to bulge outwards,
  bending the strands until they failed by fatigue.
</p>

<h3>How to replace the cable</h3>

<p>
  On my boat, the engine has to be lifted off to make enough space to
  remove the steering rod and permanently attached cable from the
  engine's tilt tube. A Yamaha F60CET weighs about 110 kg, so it's
  easy to lift if you have a workshop crane. I built a wooden gantry
  and used ratchet straps as well as tilting the boat trailer.

</p>

<p>
  Once the old steering cable was free from the engine and helm, I
  taped a pulling wire to it and pulled it out backwards, i.e. out by
  the engine and then used the pulling wire to pull the new cable in.
  Remember to pass it through the hull grommet, otherwise you get to
  pull it in twice like I did.
</p>

<h3>Could I have avoided this failure by better maintenance?</h3>

<p>
  I don't think so, short of replacing the cable regularly. The
  visible parts of the cable at the engine are all stainless steel, so
  they all looked fine. The steering didn't feel heavy. I greased the
  exposed parts every season, though perhaps previous owners didn't.
  The cable can't be disassembled, you have to cut it open to see the
  rust.
</p>

<p>
  The failure came as a complete surprise: I changed course to steer
  into a wave and the steering wheel just spun freely.  I was probably
  lucky the boat didn't turn hard. I got home by first puttering along
  at three knots and steering the engine by pushing and pulling on the
  cover and then, once out of the sea lane, I jury-rigged a tiller.
