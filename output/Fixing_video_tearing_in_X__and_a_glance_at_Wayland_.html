<h2>
Fixing video tearing in X (and a glance at Wayland)</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted November 21st 2016</em></p>
<p>
  I've used pretty much the same X setup since 1993. I'm happy
  with it. I want minimal window decorations, no click to
  focus and alt+tab to get me a new xterm and three virtual
  desktops. I don't want menus, status bars, clocks, animated
  window movement or anything like that.
</p>

<p>
  But... one thing was annoying me. When scrolling some sites,
  such as stack overflow, the browser window gets a diagonal
  tear in it. It's easiest to see in video, wikipedia has a
  reasonable <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing'>
    article with pictures</a>. Fixing this should be easy:
  redraw the screen during the vertical blanking interval.
  That's not a new idea, even the Commodore 64 had an
  interrupt you could trigger when a particular scanline was
  passed.
</p>

<p>
  The fix I ended up using was to create /etc/X11/xorg.conf with
  the TearFree option set:
</p>

<pre>
  # 2016-11-21 Debian default Xorg install doesn't have this file.
  #            MML added it to get the TearFree option.
  Section "Device"
  Identifier "Intel inbuilt graphics"
  Driver "intel"
  Option "TearFree" "true"
  EndSection
</pre>

<p>
  Fixes the problem completely. But... before I did that, I
  also tried a few other fixes.
</p>

<p>
  First, I tried switching to 'Wayland'. Wayland is a
  replacement for X. I've been meaning to take a look at it
  for a while. It's in Debian testing, so all I did is install
  'weston', shut down X and start 'weston-launch'. That works
  fine in the sense that it gets me a display and I can start
  a terminal in it. But nothing else works. No emacs outside
  the terminal, no firefox, no mplayer. I could probably get
  some or all of those to work with some more fiddling, but
  I'm not <em>that</em> interested. I'll probably take another
  look at Wayland in a year.
</p>

<p>
  Next, I tried running 'compton', which basically does the
  same thing as the TearFree option in the X server, but at a
  higher level. Compton changed the colour of my root window,
  but didn't fix the tearing. I tried the --dbe option and
  each of the five --vsync options. Didn't work. It also
  seemed to freeze up twice, getting my machine back required
  'kill -9' from a console, so I gave on on 'compton' fairly quickly.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I tried the 'xfce4' window manager. It has a
  non-default option to do compositing, which is again
  basically the same thing as the TearFree option in the X
  server. It's in Manager/window manager tweaks/compositor/
  Works fine, but I didn't really want to switch window managers.
  I'm perfectly happy with openbox.
