<h2>
Using 'fwknop' on OpenWRT</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted March 15th 2017</em></p>
<p>
  I use <a href='www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/'>fwknop</a> to limit
  network access to a server behind an TP-Link Archer C7
  running OpenWRT. Configuring 'fwknop' was fiddly, so
  I've written down how I got it working.
</p>

<h3>TP-Link Archer C7</h3>
<p>
  I chose the Archer C7 v2.0 because it's listed as working by
  OpenWRT, it has four GbE ports and a reasonably fast CPU,
  it's popular and relatively cheap.
</p>

<h3>OpenWRT</h3>
<p>
  I like OpenWRT, mostly because it lets me SSH in to the
  access point and run things like 'tcpdump'. Installing on
  the Archer C7 was not straightforward. Installing the
  15.05.1 firmware linked from openwrt.org left me with a
  device which didn't even answer 'ping'. Fortunately, there's
  a 'recovery mode' which re-flashes the device over TFTP.
  Flashing bleeding edge (50104) 'trunk' OpenWRT firmware
  fixed it. Instructions are easily googled, so I won't link them.
</p>


<h3>fwknop: what's the idea?</h3>

<p>
  I have an SSH and HTTPS server I want to access remotely.
  But I don't like having apache (HTTPS) open to the internet,
  partly because any configuration mistakes are likely to be
  exploited in no time and partly because of possible
  unpatched vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
  Limiting port-forwarding in OpenWRT to certain IP addresses
  would improve the situation, but I don't want to do that
  manually. 'fwknop' automates that.
</p>

<p>
  'fwknop' works by having a daemon listen to UDP port 66201 on a
  firewall. You can see it on the firewall by running 'ps'.  When it
  sees an UDP packet with the right credentials, it runs 'iptables'
  commands on the firewall to open up access for a specific host on
  the outside.
</p>

<h3>Installing fwknop</h3>

<p>
  Update 2018-10: Easiest way is 'opkg install luci-app-fwknopd'.
</p>

<p>
<del>
  There's a fwknop package for OpenWRT, so 'opkg install
  fwknop' does it.  Unfortunately, it didn't install cleanly,
  the post-install script bombed out. Maybe because of that
  the LUCI interface didn't seem to work. In any case, I
  wanted to understand exactly what I was doing, so I
  configured it manually.
</del>
</p>

<p>
  .fwknoprc (for my home PC):
</p>
<pre>
  [tegner]
  ACCESS                      tcp/443
  NAT_ACCESS                  10.1.2.3:443
  SPA_SERVER                  my.firewall.hostname.com
  KEY_BASE64                  /* secret */
  HMAC_KEY_BASE64             /* secret */
  USE_HMAC                    Y
  RESOLVE_IP_HTTPS            Y
  WGET_CMD                    /usr/bin/wget
</pre>

<p>'/etc/fwknop/fwknopd.conf' on the firewall required one change:</p>
<pre>
  ENABLE_IPT_FORWARDING       Y;
</pre>

<p>'/etc/fwknop/access.conf' had me confused for a while.
  First, I didn't realise that 'stanzas' have to go all
  together down the bottom, i.e. each 'stanza' starts with the
  SOURCE setting and then other settings. Second, I needed the
  'FORCE_NAT' option, which isn't documented in the config
  file 'opkg' installs. In the end my 'stanza' looked like this:
</p>

<pre>
  SOURCE              ANY
  OPEN_PORTS          tcp/443
  REQUIRE_SOURCE_ADDRESS    Y
  FW_ACCESS_TIMEOUT   500000
  FORCE_NAT           10.1.2.3 443
  KEY_BASE64          /* secret */
  HMAC_KEY_BASE64     /* secret */
</pre>

<p>
  The 'FORCE_NAT' setting is a bit weird. I initially wanted to
  use a 'DESTINATION' setting to limit forwarding to one host,
  but that seemed to cause fwknop to reject all requests.
  FORCE_NAT seems to ignore the IP address in the request and
  send to the specified one. Close enough to what I want.
</p>

<p>
  'fwknop' sends quite a bit of useful debugging information to
  the log, use 'logread -f' to watch it.
