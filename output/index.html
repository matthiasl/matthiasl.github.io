<h2>
Using 'fwknop' on OpenWRT</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted March 15th 2017</em></p>
<p>
  I use <a href='www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/'>fwknop</a> to limit
  network access to a server behind an TP-Link Archer C7
  running OpenWRT. Configuring 'fwknop' was fiddly, so
  I've written down how I got it working.
</p>

<h3>TP-Link Archer C7</h3>
<p>
  I chose the Archer C7 v2.0 because it's listed as working by
  OpenWRT, it has four GbE ports and a reasonably fast CPU,
  it's popular and relatively cheap.
</p>

<h3>OpenWRT</h3>
<p>
  I like OpenWRT, mostly because it lets me SSH in to the
  access point and run things like 'tcpdump'. Installing on
  the Archer C7 was not straightforward. Installing the
  15.05.1 firmware linked from openwrt.org left me with a
  device which didn't even answer 'ping'. Fortunately, there's
  a 'recovery mode' which re-flashes the device over TFTP.
  Flashing bleeding edge (50104) 'trunk' OpenWRT firmware
  fixed it. Instructions are easily googled, so I won't link them.
</p>


<h3>fwknop: what's the idea?</h3>

<p>
  I have an SSH and HTTPS server I want to access remotely.
  But I don't like having apache (HTTPS) open to the internet,
  partly because any configuration mistakes are likely to be
  exploited in no time and partly because of possible
  unpatched vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
  Limiting port-forwarding in OpenWRT to certain IP addresses
  would improve the situation, but I don't want to do that
  manually. 'fwknop' automates that.
</p>

<p>
  'fwknop' works by listening to UDP port 66201 on a firewall.
  When it sees an UDP packet with the right credentials, it
  runs 'iptables' commands on the firewall to open up access
  for a specific host on the outside.
</p>

<h3>Installing fwknop</h3>

<p>
  There's a fwknop package for OpenWRT, so 'opkg install
  fwknop' does it.  Unfortunately, it didn't install cleanly,
  the post-install script bombed out. Maybe because of that
  the LUCI interface didn't seem to work. In any case, I
  wanted to understand exactly what I was doing, so I
  configured it manually.
</p>

<p>
  .fwknoprc (for my home PC):
</p>
<pre>
  [tegner]
  ACCESS                      tcp/443
  NAT_ACCESS                  10.1.2.3:443
  SPA_SERVER                  my.firewall.hostname.com
  KEY_BASE64                  /* secret */
  HMAC_KEY_BASE64             /* secret */
  USE_HMAC                    Y
  RESOLVE_IP_HTTPS            Y
  WGET_CMD                    /usr/bin/wget
</pre>

<p>'/etc/fwknop/fwknopd.conf' on the firewall required one change:</p>
<pre>
  ENABLE_IPT_FORWARDING       Y;
</pre>

<p>'/etc/fwknop/access.conf' had me confused for a while.
  First, I didn't realise that 'stanzas' have to go all
  together down the bottom, i.e. each 'stanza' starts with the
  SOURCE setting and then other settings. Second, I needed the
  'FORCE_NAT' option, which isn't documented in the config
  file 'opkg' installs. In the end my 'stanza' looked like this:
</p>

<pre>
  SOURCE              ANY
  OPEN_PORTS          tcp/443
  REQUIRE_SOURCE_ADDRESS    Y
  FW_ACCESS_TIMEOUT   500000
  FORCE_NAT           10.1.2.3 443
  KEY_BASE64          /* secret */
  HMAC_KEY_BASE64     /* secret */
</pre>

<p>
  The 'FORCE_NAT' setting is a bit weird. I initially wanted to
  use a 'DESTINATION' setting to limit forwarding to one host,
  but that seemed to cause fwknop to reject all requests.
  FORCE_NAT seems to ignore the IP address in the request and
  send to the specified one. Close enough to what I want.
</p>

<p>
  'fwknop' sends quite a bit of useful debugging information to
  the log, use 'logread -f' to watch it.

Watermarking a PDF with ghostscript</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted December 7th 2016</em></p>
<p>
  Transforming an existing PDF so that it gets something like
  'Draft' stamped across each page is surprisingly easy with
  ghostscript. Shell script:
</p>

<pre>
#!
# Add a watermark to a PDF file
#
# first argument: the filename
# second argument: the watermark text (default "watermark")

filename=$1
watermark=$2

if [ x$2 == x ]; then watermark="watermark"; fi

cat &gt; /tmp/watermark.ps &lt;&lt; HERE
&lt;&lt;
   /EndPage
   {
     2 eq { pop false }
     {
         gsave
         0.5 .setopacityalpha
         /Helvetica_Bold 120 selectfont
         .65 setgray 130 70 moveto 50 rotate ($watermark) show
         grestore
         true
     } ifelse
   } bind
&gt;&gt; setpagedevice
HERE

gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=watermarked_$filename /tmp/watermark.ps $filename
</pre>

<p>
  There are three tricks above. First, you have to know about
  the 'EndPage' hook in postscript. It's code executed at the
  end of each page. Second, you have to know that the
  parameter can be 0, 1 or 2, depending on the reason for the
  'EndPage'. The postscript reference manual explains what the
  codes mean, but we're interested in all but 2. Third,
  there's the '.setopacityalpha' operator, which I think only
  works in PostScript 1.4, but that's OK because that's pretty
  standard now.
</p>

<p>
  (The temporary file is ugly. Sorry.)

OpenWrt on a TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v3</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted December 5th 2016</em></p>
<p>
  Getting this to work was surprisingly rough. I ran into
  trouble with OpenWrt versions, broken old config and
  interface name confusion. But it's nice now that it works.
</p>

<h3>Firmware update</h3>
<p>
  The current (2016-12) stable version of OpenWrt is "Chaos
  Calmber 15.05.1". That version has support for v1 and v2 of
  my access point, but not v3. According to one page I found,
  you can hack (by editing one byte) the v2 image to install
  it on a v3 device, but that seemed too risky. I installed
  a daily snapshot from a few days back instead.
</p>

<p>
  I did the install via the CLI, using 'scp' to copy the file
  to /tmp and 'sysupgrade' to do the install.
</p>

<h3>LUCI</h3>

<p>
  Snapshots don't include LUCI, the browser UI. So I installed
  that with 'opkg update' and 'opkg install luci'.
</p>

<h3>Old/Broken settings</h3>

<p>
  Both before and after upgrading, the wired interfaces on
  the access point worked fine but the wireless was 'disabled'
  no matter what I did. I couldn't figure out what was wrong and
  ended up re-installing the firmware via LUCI and unchecking the
  'retain settings' box. After that, wireless worked.
</p>

<h3>Guest wireless</h3>

<p>
  Mostly for fun, I set up an unencrypted guest network alongside
  my regular network. I did that entirely in LUCI. I put it
  in its own network, 'guest_nw'. To get that talking to the
  outside world, I had to add forwarding to the 'wan'.
</p>

<p>
  I also installed 'SQM QOS', i.e. 'opkg install ...' and
  limited the bandwidth for the guest network. It's a bit
  tricky to figure out which 'interface name' relates to
  which wireless network, in my case it was 'wlan0-1'.

Adjusting the external monitor backlight</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted November 30th 2016</em></p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
  sudo modprobe i2c-dev
  ddccontrol dev:/dev/i2c-7 -r 0x10 -w 15
</pre>

<p>
  'i2cdetect -l' is useful for finding if there is an I2C
  adaptor.  The register number, 0x10, can be read out by
  running 'ddccontrol' without arguments.
</p>

<p>
  Addendum: to make the above work without 'sudo' and without
  having the manually load a module:</p>

<pre>
  sudo adduser &lt;username&gt; i2c
    sudo /bin/sh -c 'echo i2c-dev >> /etc/modules'

Fixing video tearing in X (and a glance at Wayland)</h2></h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted November 21st 2016</em></p>
<p>
  I've used pretty much the same X setup since 1993. I'm happy
  with it. I want minimal window decorations, no click to
  focus and alt+tab to get me a new xterm and three virtual
  desktops. I don't want menus, status bars, clocks, animated
  window movement or anything like that.
</p>

<p>
  But... one thing was annoying me. When scrolling some sites,
  such as stack overflow, the browser window gets a diagonal
  tear in it. It's easiest to see in video, wikipedia has a
  reasonable <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing'>
    article with pictures</a>. Fixing this should be easy:
  redraw the screen during the vertical blanking interval.
  That's not a new idea, even the Commodore 64 had an
  interrupt you could trigger when a particular scanline was
  passed.
</p>

<p>
  The fix I ended up using was to create /etc/X11/xorg.conf with
  the TearFree option set:
</p>

<pre>
  # 2016-11-21 Debian default Xorg install doesn't have this file.
  #            MML added it to get the TearFree option.
  Section "Device"
  Identifier "Intel inbuilt graphics"
  Driver "intel"
  Option "TearFree" "true"
  EndSection
</pre>

<p>
  Fixes the problem completely. But... before I did that, I
  also tried a few other fixes.
</p>

<p>
  First, I tried switching to 'Wayland'. Wayland is a
  replacement for X. I've been meaning to take a look at it
  for a while. It's in Debian testing, so all I did is install
  'weston', shut down X and start 'weston-launch'. That works
  fine in the sense that it gets me a display and I can start
  a terminal in it. But nothing else works. No emacs outside
  the terminal, no firefox, no mplayer. I could probably get
  some or all of those to work with some more fiddling, but
  I'm not <em>that</em> interested. I'll probably take another
  look at Wayland in a year.
</p>

<p>
  Next, I tried running 'compton', which basically does the
  same thing as the TearFree option in the X server, but at a
  higher level. Compton changed the colour of my root window,
  but didn't fix the tearing. I tried the --dbe option and
  each of the five --vsync options. Didn't work. It also
  seemed to freeze up twice, getting my machine back required
  'kill -9' from a console, so I gave on on 'compton' fairly quickly.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I tried the 'xfce4' window manager. It has a
  non-default option to do compositing, which is again
  basically the same thing as the TearFree option in the X
  server. It's in Manager/window manager tweaks/compositor/
  Works fine, but I didn't really want to switch window managers.
  I'm perfectly happy with openbox.

Using a 'bash' function to silence GTK 3.20</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted October 5th 2016</em></p>
<p>
  Emacs and mutt started spewing warnings in my xterms a month
  or two ago. They look like this:
</p>

<pre>
(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.
</pre>

<p>
  The warnings annoy me. They're not relevant to what I'm doing;
  they're a GTK problem or an emacs problem. I silenced the
  warnings by adding this to my .bashrc:
</p>

<pre>
# 2016-10. GTK has an annoying new warning which causes emacs and lots
# of other X program to spew things like "GtkWindow 0xd34290 is drawn..."
# on stderr. So we have this function which redirects emacs and mutt stderr
# to /dev/null
#
# We can remove this when GTK disable the warning again, which will
# probably happen by 2017-06.
emacs()
{
  /usr/bin/emacs $* 2>/dev/null
}

mutt()
{
  /usr/bin/mutt $* 2>/dev/null
}
</pre>

<p>
  This lets me type 'emacs myfile.txt' and get an emacs started
  which doesn't dump rubbish in my terminal.
</p>

<p>
  (I could have used an <i>alias</i> for 'mutt', since I
  pretty much always run mutt without arguments. But for 'emacs'
  I had to use a function because I want the arguments passed.)
</p>

<p>
  FWIW, here's the
  <a href='https://mail.gnome.org/archives/commits-list/2016-May/msg06553.html'>
    commit</a> that made GTK dump debugging information to
  stderr by default. And here's
  the <a href='https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=54fdcb3ffac3383432b379f3e16e8cb0086b8101'>commit</a>
  which fixed it again.
</p>

<p>
  Edit 2016-11-21: underlying problem is now fixed in Debian
  testing, so the above workaround is no longer needed.

Having an online resume without Linkedin</h2>
<p class='posted'>
<em>Posted September 14th 2016</em></p>
<p>
  I've reduced my LinkedIn network to zero contacts, by hitting
  'remove' on each contact. That lets me keep a LinkedIn account to
  view people's profiles without having to wade through bogus
  endorsements and easily ignore Linkedin nagging me to expand my
  network.
</p>

<p>
  I figure I may as well just put my Linkedin profile here, since
  Linkedin arbitrarily hides it unless you 'upgrade your account'.
