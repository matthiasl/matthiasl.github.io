Title: Getting my Seagate NAS to mount again (CIFS/SMB v 1.0)
Tags: blog
Date: 17. November 2017

<p>
  About a month ago, my Seagate GoFlex NAS failed to mount.  The
  problem was that linux kernel 4.13 changed the default protocol
  version to one which the NAS doesn't support. Solution is to
  add 'vers=1.0' to the options in fstab.
</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>
  My NAS didn't mount on reboot after a Debian upgrade about a month
  ago. Mounting manually got me a pretty useless error message:
</p>
<pre>
  # mount -t cifs "//192.168.1.3/GoFlex Home Backup" /mnt --verbose -o username=XXXXXX -o password=XXXXXXX
mount.cifs kernel mount options: ip=192.168.1.3,unc=\\192.168.1.3\GoFlex Home Backup,user=XXXXX,pass=********
mount error(112): Host is down
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)
</pre>

<h3>Actual problem</h3>
<p>
  The actual problem is that the kernel now uses SMB protocol version
  3.0 by default. The man page, MOUNT.CIFS(8) claims the opposite,
  but it's dated 2010, so not very surprising.
</p>

<h3>Fix</h3>

<p>
  Add the 'vers=1.0' option, either via -o or in /etc/fstab
</p>

<h3>Maybe a better fix</h3>
<p>
  A longer term fix would be to run better NAS software on the GoFlex,
  something that could talk SMB 3.0. Seagate's software isn't great,
  it wants flash (!) for the HTTP config interface and I haven't been
  able to update the firmware for several years.

    OpenStora</a> looks like it could work. The SSH login instructions
  on that page worked fine, I can see the GoFlex is running a kernel from
  2010.
