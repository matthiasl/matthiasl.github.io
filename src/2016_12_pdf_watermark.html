Title: Watermarking a PDF with ghostscript
Tags: blog
Date: 7. December 2016

<p>
  Transforming an existing PDF so that it gets something like
  'Draft' stamped across each page is surprisingly easy with
  ghostscript. Shell script:
</p>

<pre>
#!
# Add a watermark to a PDF file
#
# first argument: the filename
# second argument: the watermark text (default "watermark")

filename=$1
watermark=$2

if [ x$2 == x ]; then watermark="watermark"; fi

cat &gt; /tmp/watermark.ps &lt;&lt; HERE
&lt;&lt;
   /EndPage
   {
     2 eq { pop false }
     {
         gsave
         0.5 .setopacityalpha
         /Helvetica_Bold 120 selectfont
         .65 setgray 130 70 moveto 50 rotate ($watermark) show
         grestore
         true
     } ifelse
   } bind
&gt;&gt; setpagedevice

gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=watermarked_$filename /tmp/watermark.ps $filename
</pre>

  There are three tricks above. First, you have to know about
  the 'EndPage' hook in postscript. It's code executed at the
  end of each page. Second, you have to know that the
  parameter can be 0, 1 or 2, depending on the reason for the
  'EndPage'. The postscript reference manual explains what the
  codes mean, but we're interested in all but 2. Third,
  there's the '.setopacityalpha' operator, which I think only
  works in PostScript 1.4, but that's OK because that's pretty
  standard now.
