Title: Having an online resume without Linkedin
Tags: blog
Date: 14. September 2016

<p>
  I've reduced my LinkedIn network to zero contacts, by hitting
  'remove' on each contact. That lets me keep a LinkedIn account to
  view people's profiles without having to wade through bogus
  endorsements and easily ignore Linkedin nagging me to expand my
  network.
</p>

<p>
  I figure I may as well just put my Linkedin profile here, since
  Linkedin arbitrarily hides it unless you 'upgrade your account'.

  <p>
    I write software on Corelatus' own hardware, dividing my time
    roughly evenly between writing for TI DSPs, C on linux and
    Erlang. Most of that is telecom-specific, e.g. the lower levels of
    SS7 and ATM and signal processing.
