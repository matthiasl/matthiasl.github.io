Title: Using a 'bash' function to silence GTK 3.20
Tags: blog
Date: 5. October 2016

<p>
  Emacs and mutt started spewing warnings in my xterms a month
  or two ago. They look like this:
</p>

<pre>
(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.
</pre>

<p>
  The warnings annoy me. They're not relevant to what I'm doing;
  they're a GTK problem or an emacs problem. I silenced the
  warnings by adding this to my .bashrc:
</p>

<pre>
# 2016-10. GTK has an annoying new warning which causes emacs and lots
# of other X program to spew things like "GtkWindow 0xd34290 is drawn..."
# on stderr. So we have this function which redirects emacs and mutt stderr
# to /dev/null
#
# We can remove this when GTK disable the warning again, which will
# probably happen by 2017-06.
emacs()
{
  /usr/bin/emacs $* 2>/dev/null
}

mutt()
{
  /usr/bin/mutt $* 2>/dev/null
}
</pre>

<p>
  This lets me type 'emacs myfile.txt' and get an emacs started
  which doesn't dump rubbish in my terminal.
</p>

<p>
  (I could have used an <i>alias</i> for 'mutt', since I
  pretty much always run mutt without arguments. But for 'emacs'
  I had to use a function because I want the arguments passed.)
</p>

<p>
  FWIW, here's the
  <a href='https://mail.gnome.org/archives/commits-list/2016-May/msg06553.html'>
    commit</a> that made GTK dump debugging information to
  stderr by default. And here's
  the <a href='https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=54fdcb3ffac3383432b379f3e16e8cb0086b8101'>commit</a>
  which fixed it again.
</p>

<p>
  Edit 2016-11-21: underlying problem is now fixed in Debian
  testing, so the above workaround is no longer needed.
