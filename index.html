        <h2>
          Using a 'bash' function to silence GTK 3.20</h2>
        <p class='posted'>
          <em>Posted October 5th 2016</em></p>

        <p>
          Emacs and mutt started spewing warnings in my xterms a month
          or two ago. They look like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.
        </pre>

        <p>
          The warnings annoy me. They're not relevant to what I'm doing;
          they're a GTK problem or an emacs problem. I silenced the
          warnings by adding this to my .bashrc:
        </p>

        <pre>
# 2016-10. GTK has an annoying new warning which causes emacs and lots
# of other X program to spew things like "GtkWindow 0xd34290 is drawn..."
# on stderr. So we have this function which redirects emacs and mutt stderr
# to /dev/null
#
# We can remove this when GTK disable the warning again, which will
# probably happen by 2017-06.
emacs()
{
  /usr/bin/emacs $* 2>/dev/null
}

mutt()
{
  /usr/bin/mutt $* 2>/dev/null
}
        </pre>

        <p>
          This lets me type 'emacs myfile.txt' and get an emacs started
          which doesn't dump rubbish in my terminal.
        </p>

        <p>
          (I could have used an <emph>alias</emph> for 'mutt', since I
          pretty much always run mutt without arguments. But for 'emacs'
          I had to use a function because I want the arguments passed.)
        </p>

        <p>
          FWIW, here's the
          <a href='https://mail.gnome.org/archives/commits-list/2016-May/msg06553.html'>
            commit</a> that made GTK dump debugging information to
          stderr by default. And here's
          the <a href='https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=54fdcb3ffac3383432b379f3e16e8cb0086b8101'>commit</a>
          which fixed it again.

        <p>
          I've reduced my LinkedIn network to zero contacts, by hitting
          'remove' on each contact. That lets me keep a LinkedIn account to
          view people's profiles without having to wade through bogus
          endorsements and easily ignore Linkedin nagging me to expand my
          network.
        </p>

        <p>
          I figure I may as well just put my Linkedin profile here, since
          Linkedin arbitrarily hides it unless you 'upgrade your account'.

          I write software on Corelatus' own hardware, dividing my time
          roughly evenly between writing for TI DSPs, C on linux and
          Erlang. Most of that is telecom-specific, e.g. the lower levels of
          SS7 and ATM and signal processing.
