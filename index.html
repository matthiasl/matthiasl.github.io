        <h2>
          Fixing video tearing in X (and a glance at Wayland)</h2>
        <p class='posted'>
          <em>Posted November 21st 2016</em></p>

        <p>
          I've used pretty much the same X setup since 1993. I'm happy
          with it. I want minimal window decorations, no click to
          focus and alt+tab to get me a new xterm and three virtual
          desktops. I don't want menus, status bars, clocks, animated
          window movement or anything like that.
        </p>

        <p>
          But... one thing was annoying me. When scrolling some sites,
          such as stack overflow, the browser window gets a diagonal
          tear in it. It's easiest to see in video, wikipedia has a
          reasonable <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing'>
          article with pictures</a>. Fixing this should be easy:
          redraw the screen during the vertical blanking interval.
          That's not a new idea, even the Commodore 64 had an
          interrupt you could trigger when a particular scanline was
          passed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fix I ended up using was to create /etc/X11/xorg.conf with
          the TearFree option set:
        </p>

        <pre>
          # 2016-11-21 Debian default Xorg install doesn't have this file.
          #            MML added it to get the TearFree option.
          Section "Device"
          Identifier "Intel inbuilt graphics"
          Driver "intel"
          Option "TearFree" "true"
          EndSection
        </pre>

        <p>
          Fixes the problem completely. But... before I did that, I
          also tried a few other fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, I tried switching to 'Wayland'. Wayland is a
          replacement for X. I've been meaning to take a look at it
          for a while. It's in Debian testing, so all I did is install
          'weston', shut down X and start 'weston-launch'. That works
          fine in the sense that it gets me a display and I can start
          a terminal in it. But nothing else works. No emacs outside
          the terminal, no firefox, no mplayer. I could probably get
          some or all of those to work with some more fiddling, but
          I'm not <em>that</em> interested. I'll probably take another
          look at Wayland in a year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, I tried running 'compton', which basically does the
          same thing as the TearFree option in the X server, but at a
          higher level. Compton changed the colour of my root window,
          but didn't fix the tearing. I tried the --dbe option and
          each of the five --vsync options. Didn't work. It also
          seemed to freeze up twice, getting my machine back required
          'kill -9' from a console, so I gave on on 'compton' fairly quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, I tried the 'xfce4' window manager. It has a
          non-default option to do compositing, which is again
          basically the same thing as the TearFree option in the X
          server. It's in Manager/window manager tweaks/compositor/
          Works fine, but I didn't really want to switch window managers.
          I'm perfectly happy with openbox.

        <h2>
          Using a 'bash' function to silence GTK 3.20</h2>
        <p class='posted'>
          <em>Posted October 5th 2016</em></p>

        <p>
          Emacs and mutt started spewing warnings in my xterms a month
          or two ago. They look like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: GtkWindow 0xd32290 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.

(emacs:7719): Gtk-WARNING **: EmacsFixed 0xd36130 is drawn without a current allocation. This should not happen.
        </pre>

        <p>
          The warnings annoy me. They're not relevant to what I'm doing;
          they're a GTK problem or an emacs problem. I silenced the
          warnings by adding this to my .bashrc:
        </p>

        <pre>
# 2016-10. GTK has an annoying new warning which causes emacs and lots
# of other X program to spew things like "GtkWindow 0xd34290 is drawn..."
# on stderr. So we have this function which redirects emacs and mutt stderr
# to /dev/null
#
# We can remove this when GTK disable the warning again, which will
# probably happen by 2017-06.
emacs()
{
  /usr/bin/emacs $* 2>/dev/null
}

mutt()
{
  /usr/bin/mutt $* 2>/dev/null
}
        </pre>

        <p>
          This lets me type 'emacs myfile.txt' and get an emacs started
          which doesn't dump rubbish in my terminal.
        </p>

        <p>
          (I could have used an <emph>alias</emph> for 'mutt', since I
          pretty much always run mutt without arguments. But for 'emacs'
          I had to use a function because I want the arguments passed.)
        </p>

        <p>
          FWIW, here's the
          <a href='https://mail.gnome.org/archives/commits-list/2016-May/msg06553.html'>
            commit</a> that made GTK dump debugging information to
          stderr by default. And here's
          the <a href='https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=54fdcb3ffac3383432b379f3e16e8cb0086b8101'>commit</a>
          which fixed it again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Edit 2016-11-21: underlying problem is now fixed in Debian
          testing, so the above workaround is no longer needed.
        </p>

          Post-LinkedIn Profile</h2>

          <em>Posted September 14th 2016</em></p>

        <p>
          I've reduced my LinkedIn network to zero contacts, by hitting
          'remove' on each contact. That lets me keep a LinkedIn account to
          view people's profiles without having to wade through bogus
          endorsements and easily ignore Linkedin nagging me to expand my
          network.
        </p>

        <p>
          I figure I may as well just put my Linkedin profile here, since
          Linkedin arbitrarily hides it unless you 'upgrade your account'.
